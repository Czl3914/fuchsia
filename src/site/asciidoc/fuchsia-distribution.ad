In order to generate a Fuchsia distribution there is only one mandatory profile the **core**, all the other modules are optional and can be included in the distribution by adding the apropriate maven profile ( *mvn -P parameter* ). The maven profile and its contents are specified right below.

* core - This module contains all the basic Fuchsia types, fuchsia shell tool is installed automatically in this profile as well, even though its not part of the bundle core
* discoveries
** http://jmdns.sourceforge.net/[mdns] - the implementation os dnssd/mdns discovery protocol
** upnp
* importers
** importer-cxf
** http://mqtt.org/[mqtt]
** https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/[push]
* exporter
** exporter-cxf
* tools
** grid
** fake

Configuration profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Config profiles are the instantiation of the _linker_ and the _processor_. Those two tend to be customized, since the filter adopted in the default instantiation of the linker might not be valid for for case

* discoveries:
** mdns-config
* importers:
** importer-cxf-config
** mqtt-config
** push-config
* exporters:
** exporter-cxf-config


Thus, in order to compile Fuchsia with the *grid*, *exporter-cxf* and *mqtt*, would be enough to:

1. go to the **distribution** directory
2. type *mvn -Pcore,grid,exporter-cxf,mqtt*

After the compilation process is finished, your Fuchsia distribution is ready to use:

1. go to the **distribution/target/chameleon-distribution/**
2. type **./chameleon.sh --interactive** (or the apropriate script according to your OS)
