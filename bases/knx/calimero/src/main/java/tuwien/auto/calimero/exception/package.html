	<body>
	Exception hierarchy containing common types of (checked) exceptions 
	thrown throughout the library by <code>public</code> or 
	<code>protected</code> visible methods.
	<p>
	In general, checked exceptions used in Calimero should extend the base exception 
	<code>KNXException</code>.
	<p>
	<b>Unchecked exceptions only:</b><br>
	Since a method might throw any type of runtime exception, even those not 
	specified here, there is no Calimero specific base exception for this.<br>
	Nevertheless, internal error states and failures originating from Calimero itself
	should be signaled through Calimero specific exceptions if possible.
