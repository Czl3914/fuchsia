		and medium information, and KNX message frame types for different 
		KNX communication media.

		and used to handle KNX messages appropriately.
		The types of settings types differentiate between KNX communication media 
		by keeping information necessary for a particular medium.
		<p>
		Different frame types are provided to encapsulate a raw frame 
		used on a particular communication medium.
