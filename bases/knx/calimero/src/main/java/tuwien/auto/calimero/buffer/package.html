	Support for temporary storage of KNX network messages.<br>
	This is done by using a network buffer with one or more configurations added to it.
	This allows to build up and maintain a local process image to answer user queries.
	Benefits might be a decreased network load and smaller response time.<br>
	Using a network buffer allows polled mode of communication, since handling of 
	incoming messages can be delayed to some later point in time.
	<br>
	A configuration determines what messages to keep and what messages to 
	ignore by the use of filters. These filters might be user defined implementations 
	set for that particular configuration. 
	Two predefined filters are available to allow state based and command based 
	network buffering.
