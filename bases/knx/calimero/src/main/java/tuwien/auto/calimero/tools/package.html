		Contains the Calimero tools, each providing a different functionality for a user.
		<p>
		A tool shows a particular feature of the Calimero library, and aims to help
		in getting familiar with the library and interact with the necessary structures.
		Nevertheless, while hopefully allowing some insight in the APIs, 
		every tool tries to offer a ready-to-use functionality on its own.<br>
		In general, the tool implementations are console based, i.e. they are 
		intended to run on a console or command line window.
		<p>
		Every tool keeps all its required code in the same file to
		avoid additional file dependencies, which should help when examining the code of
		a tool in the first place. On the other hand, local copies of some 
		utility functionality might therefore appear in different tool files.
		To check out the implementation and control flow of a tool, a good point 
		to start is the <code>main</code>-method of the particular type. 
		<p>
		Access to the KNX network can be done with KNXnet/IP, using an 
		IP network connection, or with FT1.2, using a serial port connection.
		<p>
		KNXnet/IP address considerations:<br>
		On more than one IP address assigned to the local host, and possibly 
		several local network interfaces available, the default chosen local host 
		might not be the one expected by the user. In this situation, the local IP
		address has to be supplied manually, using command line options.<br>  
		The KNXnet/IP protocol expects IPv4 addresses by default.<br> 
		Network Address Translation (NAT) aware communication can only be used, 
		if the remote KNXnet/IP server supports it. 
		Otherwise, connection timeouts will occur. With NAT enabled, 
		KNXnet/IP also works with IPv6 addresses.
